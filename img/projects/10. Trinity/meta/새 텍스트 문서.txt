The Trinity complex, design for the 3-1 grade semester. (2021)

The site is a place facing the road toward the center of Daegu, a place where nearby residents and visitors can pay attention to the gaze and movement, and will play an active pivotal role as it was developed as a residential and commercial complex in Daegu.

The huge complex will provide a space for people in the city to relax and enjoy various contents, and as a local landmark, it will revitalize the urban community by making everyone who visits feel the sense of space naturally manifested by various hierarchies.

In addition, it is expected that the main road will revitalize the inefficiently used shopping district and create a complex commercial culture base suitable for regional characteristics, laying the foundation for urban revitalization and growth in the central area of Daegu.
