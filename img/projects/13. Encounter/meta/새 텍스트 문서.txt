Encounter between the Existing and the New, design for the 3-2 grade semester. (2021)
Daegu court complex rebuilding plan

This plan propose to expand and renovate the old court complex in Daegu, which has lost its existing functions due to the current transfer, to the re-designed cultural center. 

The park close to the site is no longer treated as a general natural feature, but as part of the city's feature, I propose an extension and renovation plan that allows close relationships to be established, not isolated elements in the cities center.
