          CITY 2040, MICRO CLIMATE CONTROL CENTER, design for the 4-1 grade
          semester. (2022)<br />
          SKYHIVE Skyscraper Challenge / Edition #5 - 1ST PRIZE WINNER+BB
          STUDENT AWARD <br /><br />This skyscraper construction project was
          started based on three questions in the process of resolving the
          problem of a land, which is controversial about the direction of
          development in the metropolitan city of Daegu, Korea.<br /><br />
          Can we design skyscrapers while considering conservation perspective
          that require less development? How will the invisible identity of the
          isolated natural space within the city be architecturally resolved and
          related to the city? How can we avoid designing a huge wall between
          the city and nature? <br /><br />This skyscraper suggests the
          direction of development of the central business district from the
          perspective of preserving existing building complexes. Due to this
          development, the existing complex will be preserved as a natural space
          freely used by people in the city over time. In addition, a modular
          cultural center that can be changed flexibly will be developed
          together to actively respond to future industries. The project
          continued the tug-of-war between nature-conservation and urban
          development, with a focus on sustainable concepts and green tech to
          create eco-facilities in the city that could be used by people.<br /><br />
          Currently, there are two different positions of opinion for the land
          development plan. One is the economic opinion that the land has great
          economic and commercial potential among Daegu's commercial centers and
          high-rise buildings, so it is appropriate to build a massive
          residential and commercial complex. The second is that the development
          direction of the land should be for the public rather than economic
          purpose and make it a park for people because it faces a nature, which
          is rare in the city. After considering both points of view, I came up
          with a plan that satisfies both opinions, and developed a residential
          and commercial complex cultural center that can have both economic and
          public characteristics, accommodate a large population in the center,
          and relate it to the park to enjoy nature in the city center.
          <br /><br />The 2040 plan is a top-level spatial plan in Korea, to
          shift from the rigid urban planning to be flexible that can contain
          various future urban aspects. The site is an important place where
          major high-rise business facilities are concentrated, and is in
          contact with the road with centrality. The Daegu Court Complex will be
          relocated to another place due to aging in the 2020s, and the current
          site will lose its function, and a new plan is needed according to the
          current era. The newly developed skyscraper should be located in an
          optimal location, sustainable, minimal development, eco-friendly,
          suggest spatial possibilities to attract new industries to restore
          shrinking jobs, and remain in the city for a long time to present
          development potential to the outside.
